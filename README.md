Interactive Php Website Development
We have made two class first is in home.php for retrieving data from table requirements.
Other class name is showresults for showing and checking whether message is sent successfully or not. 
 We have made feature where once tradsman sent quotation the button on that job will not enable so that tradsman will not sent quotation for that job.

all other functionality like checking whether user is valid and showing data is their. Working perfectly fine with all the functions running completely.
